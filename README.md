# Playbook for install changedetection.io in docker container in ubuntu2004

This is my first try to create a ansible playbook.
1. It creates a user, and adds a authorized ssh key.
2. Install docker and docker composer
3. install [changedetection.io](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io), in docker container
